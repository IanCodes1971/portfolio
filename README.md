Ian Casini – Software Development Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The site showcases my background in software development, data analysis, and IT, along with selected academic and personal projects that demonstrate my technical skills, problem-solving ability, and experience building complete applications.

The portfolio itself is a project I designed and implemented to highlight not only my work, but also my ability to create, structure, and deploy a polished web application.
